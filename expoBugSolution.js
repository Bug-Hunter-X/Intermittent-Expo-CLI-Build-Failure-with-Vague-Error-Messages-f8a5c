The solution depends on the specific cause of the intermittent failure.  Common causes include:

1. **Incorrect or conflicting dependencies:** Carefully review the project's package.json file, checking for version conflicts or missing dependencies. Use tools like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn outdated` to identify potential issues.
2. **Problems with native modules:** If the project includes native modules, ensure they are properly linked and configured.
3. **Corrupted cache:** Clear the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and then retry the build.
4. **Network issues:** Make sure the network is stable and accessible.
5. **Hardware or operating system problems:**  Consider restarting your machine or conducting checks on your hardware.

**Example (Illustrative, solution depends on the actual bug):**

If the problem is due to a specific dependency, updating the version might solve it:
```javascript
// In package.json
"dependencies": {
  "expo-cli": "^5.0.0", 
  // Update other dependencies as needed
}
```

After updating dependencies run `expo prebuild --clean` and then try building again.  Remember to adapt this approach based on the specifics of your own error messages and build environment.
