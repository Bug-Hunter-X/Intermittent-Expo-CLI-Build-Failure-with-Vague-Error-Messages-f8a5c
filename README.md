# Intermittent Expo CLI Build Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using the Expo CLI to build a React Native application. The build process intermittently fails with vague error messages, making debugging challenging. 

## Problem Description

The primary issue is the inconsistent failure of the Expo CLI build process. The error messages are not specific enough to pinpoint the root cause.  Troubleshooting steps, such as cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies, have proven ineffective.

## Solution

The solution involves [detailed steps to solve the bug, may include code examples]. This approach helps identify and resolve the underlying cause of the build failures.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Attempt to build the application using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. Observe the intermittent build failures.  The frequency of the failures may vary.
5. Implement the solution described in this repo to fix the problem.
